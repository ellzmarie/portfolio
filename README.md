## Additional Libraries Used 
In this section, I'll share a list of all supporting libraries and their role in the project.

https://www.w3schools.com/
I found W3Schools very helpful when my codes were not working. I had trouble with making the image from my projects section move and found it a helpful resource.  

https://unsplash.com/photos/5JE9AQqWo_Q 
Unsplash has plenty of awesome free background images available to download. That's where I found my background. I really love 3d rendered images and absolutely loved the colors of my banner. 

https://www.flaticon.com/
Flaticon is where I found the image for my project and all the icons from my Contact section! They have lots of fun and FREE icons that I will use from here on out.

There's honestly not a day where I don't send out a GIF to someone. It's become a norm for me and had to include a fun one on my site.

## Code Snippet
This section will include a brief code snippet of functionality that I'm proud of in a brief description.

 ```
function myCoolThing() {
	// here is the code to do something really cool!
 ```
